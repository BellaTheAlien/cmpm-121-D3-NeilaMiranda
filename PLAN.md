## D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

Key technical challenge: Can you assemble a map-based user interface using the Leaflet mapping framework?
Key gameplay challenge: Can players collect and craft tokens from nearby locations to finally make one of sufficiently high value?

### Steps - D3.a

- [x] create the PLAN.md
- [x] move given code from main.ts to reference
- [x] delete everything from main.ts
- [x] place the player onto the map
- [x] draw rectangles for the cells on the map
- [x] allow the player to collect tokens
- [x] add a clue/tool for players to find - ranks to the tokens
- [x] create an invatory UI for the player's items
- [x] the player can carry items to diffrent cells

### Steps - D3.b

- [] create player movement
- [x] player radius UI
- [] can drop current token
- [] vitory by creating the 3rd rank token
